Traffic Signs Detection using Neural Net and Deep Learning
 
In this article we use DIGITS to train Object Detection neural network using the Caffe back-end. In this particular work, base model Alexnet to train a neural network Traffic Signs Detection.
 
## Dataset
  This walk-through was created using images and labels from the German Traffic Sign Benchmark from their [web site] (http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsdb&subsection=dataset.)

## Data used into DIGITS
